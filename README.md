# braingrad

Essentially, braingrad is a lightweight deep learning library.

We aim to implement as many features as possible to make it capable of training basic neural network tasks.

## Features:
* Tensor object
* Automatic differentiantion engine
* Forward propagation
* Some loss and activation functions
* SGD optimizer

## TODO:
* Refactor autograd
* Creating sequential models
* Documentation
